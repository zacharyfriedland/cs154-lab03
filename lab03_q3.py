### Implementing and simulating multiplexers in PyRTL ###

import pyrtl

# Now, it is time to build and simulate (for 16 cycles) a 3-bit 5:1 MUX.
# You can develop your design using either Boolean gates as above or PyRTL's
# conditional assignment.

# Declare data inputs
# < add your code here >

# Declare control inputs
s = pyrtl.Input(bitwidth=3, name='s')

# Declare outputs 
# < add your code here >

# Describe your 5:1 MUX implementation
# < add your code here >

# Simulate and test your design for 16 cycles using random inputs
# < add your code here >
